</h>
<h scale="0.6">
This branch serves for time-limited development tests that are open to the community. Our goal in each of these tests is to gather performance and stability data from servers under heavy load.

We'll only run the Stress Tests when our development team needs data and/or specific feedback. Stress Tests will be announced on our Twitter and Forums, and will usually run for a couple of hours.

Stress Tests do not represent a typical DayZ 0.63 gameplay experience. Spawn points, starting gear, loot, and also the available feature set are all modified for the purpose of specific test cases.
